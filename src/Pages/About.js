      <h2>About My Journey</h2>
      <p>I am an aspiring web developer who is currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. My focus is on building small, clean projects to strengthen my coding skills. I am also learning Git and GitHub to manage and share my work effectively. This portfolio will grow over time as I add more projects and improve as a developer.</p>
